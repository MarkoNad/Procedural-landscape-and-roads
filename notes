MasterRenderer::prepare: switch clear and clearColor
samplingDistance in SimplexHeightGenerator => perhaps set to distance of the neighboring vertex
Vertex constructor - replace this(new ArrayList<>() with null)

not sure what to do with #issue1 in Roads:
	prevDirection.y = 0;
	nextDirection.y = 0;





vert and frag shaders -> unique variable names (they collide)

TODO
- hardkodirano 600 u BiomesMap::getTreeType
- probabilities for pines and oaks
- exception if not all models in lod grid have defined scales in constructor
- Road::generateTrajectory replace default segment length with given one
- fix infinite cells (don't traverse all of them)
- max height

IMPORTANT
goesThroughMountainDetection perhaps need to be done with more than
one point that has at least minimal tunnel depth. It is possible that
too much is excavated, even that entrance and exit are the same point, 
and everything else is excavated.
