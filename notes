TODO
- hardkodirano 600 u BiomesMap::getTreeType
- probabilities for pines and oaks
- exception if not all models in lod grid have defined scales in constructor
- Road::generateTrajectory replace default segment length with given one
- fix infinite cells (don't traverse all of them)
- max height
